He took all the
vegetable bits, washed 
them and cleaned them 
well.
Then he cut them into 
long strips. He put them 
in a huge pot and placed 
it on the fire to cook. 
Next, he ground some 
fresh coconut, green
chillies and gar lic
together. He added this 
paste and some salt to the cooking vegetables.
A tempting smell started coming from the pot.
Now he whipped some curd and added it to the 
curry. He also poured a few spoonfuls of coconut oil 
and decorated the dish with curry leaves.
Lo and behold! The new dish was ready.
The cook served this new dish to the guests that 
evening.
